# stdx
this contains a bunch of string and file IO functions to just make it easier for me to do Stuff

this is mostly just for my personal projects and so it could have memory leaks and UB (i wrote this a while ago) but if you wanna use this then go ahead

i wrote this while switching from windows to linux so the platform dependant stuff (iox.h) works on both platforms
