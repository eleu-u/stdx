# stdx
header only libraries for making high level programming in C easier for me

this contains a bunch of string and file IO functions to just make it easier for me to do Stuff
(there could be memory leaks and UB i wrote this a while ago so please dont actually use this)

this is mostly just for my personal projects but if you wanna use this then go ahead

works on both windows/linux
